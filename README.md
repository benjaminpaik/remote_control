# remote_control

A remote control for a BLE device.

## Getting Started

This project is an app for controlling custom embedded devices over bluetooth. It provides a scrollbar and a mode selector for sending commands to the embedded device. It also has an oscilloscope for real-time telemetry. This app was tested with a custom PCB with the BLUENRG-M2SP bluetooth module and an ESP32-C3.
